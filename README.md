rbdnd is my first attempt at making any kind of 2d game. It is entirely text-based and does not use curses.
<br/>
For the 2d plane, I have a vector, y, and for each element in this vector I have another vector that represents the x plane on the given y plane. 
<br/>
These vectors can then be populated with chars to add elements to the map.
<br/>
Current time spent on project: approximately 15-20 minutes.....
